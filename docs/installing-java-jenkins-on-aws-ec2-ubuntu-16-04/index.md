With this blog you will get insight into the process of installing Java & Jenkins on AWS ec2 Ubuntu 16.04.

## Pre-requisite:

For this lab to proceed, following are the pre-requirements

1. Two AWS ec2 instances with AMI as Ubuntu 16.04 being launched.
2. One AWS ec2 Ubuntu instance with Apache2 and php installed ([Click here to learn their installation](https://devops4solutions.com/apache2-php5-6-aws-ec2-ubuntu-16-04-installation/)).

## **Installing Java on AWS ec2 Ubuntu 16.04 instance:**

Step 1. Sign in to the Console of your AWS account.

Step 2. Connect to the launched Ubuntu instances (via [PUTTY](https://devops4solutions.com/aws-ec2-linux-instance-launch/) if a Windows user)

Step 3. Type the following commands :

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

Step 4. Check the java version installed

```
java -version
```

Step 5. In order to help Jenkins( or any Java based application) to point to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) properly, we are required to set JAVA\_HOME environment variable.

Set JAVA\_HOME:

Java 1.8 has been successfully installed. Now, lets move forward and install Jenkins.

## **Installing Jenkins on AWS ec2 Ubuntu 16.04 instance:**

Following steps are used;

Step 1. To use the debian package repository of Jenkins to automate installation and upgrade, first add the following key:

wget -q -O - [https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key](https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key) | sudo apt-key add -

Step 2. Add the following entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list

sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'

Step 3. Now run the following commands:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins

Step 4. Go to the browser : <ip\_address>:8080

Step 5. Go to the mentioned directory path using cat command in order to view the initialAdminPassword generated by default.

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the generated password and paste in the “Administrator Password” section as shown above.
